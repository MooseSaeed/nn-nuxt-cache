## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute in the boilerplate don't remove it. If you remove it, your code may be invalid for the certificate.

- TailwindCSS is preinstalled and with default config. It might be helpful for you if you want to have some styles. Or if you'd like to see a pretty result as you develop. You can use the following semantic classes that have been included: `TODO-class-1`, `TODO-class-2`

- It is NOT necessary to have the exact same styles as in the GIF above, or even any styles at all.

- If you're a TypeScript beginner and encounter some issues with it in the challenge, you can skip it by using `// @ts-expect-error` comment on the line above the error.
